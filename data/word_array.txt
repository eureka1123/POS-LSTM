A Cleveland Plain Dealer article refers to the " skyrocketing population figures of blacks and Hispanic youth .
" Time magazine devoted its 9 April 1990 cover story to " America 's Changing Colors , " and asked on its cover , " What will the U.S. be like when whites are no longer the majority ?
" These new demographics , as such projections are frequently and approvingly called , are invoked by educators to argue that inevitable demographic changes require a transformation of American schools and colleges , particularly in curriculum .
This is one of the most popular ideas in American education today .
Proclaimed in educational publications , reports , and conferences , it is ubiquitous and unchallenged .
Workforce 2000 <p> The source of the new demographics is Workforce 2000 , a report that has proved far more influential than its authors probably envisioned .
Workforce 2000 deserves much of the attention it has received .
Published in 1987 by the United States Department of Labor , it compiles studies by the Hudson Institute on the nation 's and The purpose of Workforce 2000 is to alert policy makers of the social changes that may affect American productivity and competitiveness .
The research is carefully done , and its implications are effectively elaborated .
Sparing the readers social scientific jargon , the report is also refreshingly readable .
<p> The serpent in the garden , however , is this short sentence : " The cumulative impact of the changing ethnic and racial composition of the labor force will be dramatic .
" 1 Somebody got carried away rhetorically , and the editors let it slip by .
For this statement simply is not substantiated .
<p> The report does show that by the year 2000 women , blacks , Hispanics , and immigrants will make up 85 percent of new job seekers .
But this is the percentage of new job seekers , not the percentage of the total workforce .
More importantly , the categories themselves are misleading because white women are the largest " minority " group listed .
White women , according to Workforce 2000 , will account for 42 percent of new entrants into the workforce white and nonwhite , will account for 22 percent , leaving 20 percent to native nonwhite males and females , and 15 percent to native white males .
These numbers seem to indicate a revolutionary transformation of America 's ethnic profile -- but only if one forgets that white women have been included in the minority population , and only if one confuses new job seekers with the total workforce or the total population .
<p> According to Workforce 2000 , " black women will comprise the largest share of the increase in the non-white labor force .
" In fact , " black women will outnumber black men in the workforce .
" This statistic suggests that the increase in the numbers of working black women is due more to their being women than to their being black .
It does not prove that the total percentage of the population that is black is increasing dramatically .
<p> Nevertheless , the new demographics have popularized the notion that minorities will become the majority over the next couple of decades .
That simply is not true. 2 Minority groups as they 3 are increasing in inverse proportion to their relative size .
That is to say , the most rapidly growing minority groups are also the smallest ( see table 1 ) .
<p> Asians are the fastest growing minority .
Between 1970 and 1980 , America 's Asian population grew 143 percent , but Asians make up a small percent of the American population .
Despite its large growth rate , the Asian population grew from only 0.7 percent of the American population in 1970 to 1.5 percent in 1980. 4 The highest estimates suggest that by the year 2000 , Asians may grow to as much as 4 percent of the population .
Similarly , the growth of America 's Hispanic population will not soon make Hispanics a large group .
This population grew 39 percent between 1980 and 1989 , a seemingly large rate , but it caused the Hispanic population to grow from only 6.3 percent of the American population to its current 8.2 percent. 5 ( Of course , in California and Texas , Hispanics do make up a large proportion of local communities .
) Finally , is growing the most slowly of all .
Blacks currently constitute about 12.5 percent of the population ; they will make up 13.1 percent by the year 2000 and 14 percent by 2025 .
Some Nonimplications for Higher Education <p> The mistaken conclusion that America 's ethnic minorities will become the majority has been eagerly seized on by many educators and taken to a still more absurd extreme , namely , that the population of college students will soon be composed predominantly of minorities .
But even if minorities were to become the majority in the total population , the evidence indicates that the same result would not be achieved , at least not automatically , in the student population .
American Indians , for example , are underrepresented in higher education when compared to their fraction of the population of the United States .
In 1988 , American Indians made up only 0.7 percent of American college enrollments. 6 Asians are well represented , but they constitute a small fraction of the population .
College-age blacks ( like college-age whites ) are actually a shrinking cohort .
From 1979 by 11 percent. 7 The Hispanic population is growing in the United States , but this fact does not automatically translate into hopeful projections for college attendance .
According to a study by Arthur Levine and Associates : <p> The growth of Hispanic enrollment is not yet fully apparent in secondary and postsecondary education because the Hispanic population is very young , it continues to drop out of high school at a high rate , and the fraction of Hispanic high school graduates going on to college has declined since the 1970s. 8 <p> We all wish that more minorities , especially underrepresented minorities , would attend college .
Better practices in grade school and high school and increased transfer opportunities from two-year colleges , where most minority freshman enroll , might help .
But even the most optimistic projections of minority participation do not suggest that minorities will transform American higher education .
<p> Furthermore , those who draw pedagogic and curricular implications from the new demographics ignore the diversity within the large ethnic categories they feature .
For example , to discuss the educational patterns of Hispanics , one former showing relatively dismal participation in higher education , while the latter are well represented .
In a similar vein , M. Yukie Tokuyama complains that the Asian groups identified by the United States Census Bureau " exhibit different employment patterns , occupations , incomes , and poverty levels .
Moreover , there are differences within subgroups-linguistic , political , educational , generational , and occupational .
" 9 Yet , many educators and journalists persist in claiming that broadly-defined minority groups , each assumed to be monolithic , will all demand exactly the same change in higher education .
Multiculturalism <p> The change minority students are supposed to demand is that undergraduate curricula should include the study of minority and Third World cultures , necessarily at the expense of the traditional , supposedly " Eurocentric " curriculum .
Thus , some educators are using the new demographics to argue for the justice , wisdom , and inevitability of so-called multiculturalism .
But even if the exaggerations of the new demographics and its academic corollary were true , do demographic trends really compel curricular changes ?
<p> No one ever thought on European cultural achievements , was justified on the ground that most Americans are of European descent .
On the contrary , the justification for that curriculum has been that the American polity-its social , economic , and political system-derives from European antecedents and has been informed by the thought of European philosophers .
Beyond that , further justification for the European emphasis follows from the fact that liberal education originated in ancient Greece and all of the disciplines it now comprises developed within that tradition , albeit with heavy , repeated , and crucial borrowings from a wide variety of non-European cultures .
It is , therefore , not at all obvious that changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of the population should have any effect on college curricula .
The purpose of American education has been to prepare our young people for the future and not to tie them to their ancestral past .
<p> In what approaches a parody of the argument from demographics to curriculum , Annette Kolodny , dean of the faculty of humanities at the University of Arizona , writes in the Chronicle of way , " colleges should change teaching practices : " different cultural groups may emphasize one cognitive style over another-for example , reasoning by analogy instead of strict linear logic .
" 10 Dean Kolodny does not identify which cultural groups lack the capacity for logic , though she claims that at one university : <p> young women were using empathy as a learning strategy .
What frustrated them was that their instructors rarely introduced specific case histories ; raw data abstracted from case studies made up the bulk of the material presented in the classroom .
In that learning context , the men performed better than the women .
And the women switched majors .
<p> What ugly thoughts lurk behind such statements ?
Can women not think as well as men ?
Do individuals of different ethnic groups have different mental capacities ?
Dean Kolodny does not pause to consider the practical implications such differences would have .
<p> Echoing the alarmist rhetoric of nineteenth-century Nativist and Know-Nothing movements , the new demographics proponents picture current immigrants as intractable agents of alien cultures that will forever transform the culture this : because the major sources of American immigration these days are nationalities that ( by chance ) fit America 's conventional taxonomy of minorities ( namely , Asians and Hispanics ) , immigration patterns require a concomitant multicultural response , especially in school curricula .
<p> In fact , today 's immigrants largely mirror the culture they are about to join .
For example , a recent survey of immigrants found that " the newcomers , whether Arabs , Vietnamese , or other Asians , are mostly Christians .
" 11 And Barry A. Kosmin , who conducted the study , stated that " most immigrants are in the mainstream of the Judeo-Christian culture .
" ( The survey revealed that 86.5 percent of the immigrants declared that they were Christian , 1.8 percent Jewish , and the balanced stated no religion or simply did not respond .
) If this is true for their religious beliefs , why should we assume that immigrants differ in other cultural respects from the present population of the United States ?
In particular , why should we expect that they want their children Americans or past immigrants ?
Would it not be more reasonable to assume that immigrants come to America , in part , to provide their children the educational benefits our schools are already known to provide ?
<p> Besides , there is nothing new about large numbers of immigrants coming to the United States .
Consider that in 1980 , 6 percent of Americans were foreign born compared to 9 percent in 1940 and 13 percent in 1920. 12 The United States has a long history of diverse immigration , the most diverse in the New World , according to Roger Daniels , who concludes that although the United States received a variety of Europeans during the colonial period , other colonized countries , such as Canada , Australia , and those of Latin America showed a comparatively homogeneous immigrant pattern. 13 Many kinds of immigrants have come to America and enriched it , but they did not come to replicate what they left .
Indeed , many wished to escape their native countries ' most pernicious elements .
<p> Why encourage minorities to attend college only to deny them the force minority students to undertake a multicultural curriculum at the expense of courses traditional college students took to secure seats in professional schools and careers ?
Why insist that minorities should attend college only to change college for them , as if they were not worthy of it as it was ?
Thoughtlessness or Worse <p> Proponents of a " multicultural " curriculum advance many arguments to justify their revolutionary demands .
Yet their uncritical acceptance of demographic claims unsupported by any evidence -- and the eagerness with which they have used those claims to make " multiculturalism " appear inevitable -- makes one wonder about the character of their commitment .
Indeed , their version of multiculturalism fits all too well with the broader desire , evident in certain circles since the 1960s , to denigrate the ideals of the West and to dismantle its institutions .
<p> Whether with that motive or merely out of a thoughtless anxiety not to be left off the latest bandwagon , various members of the educational establishment have cited Workforce 2000 as if it were a fiery sword pointing us toward a new Ford Foundation awarded nineteen American universities " cultural diversity " grants .
The program 's goal , a foundation press release explained , was to ensure that colleges " keep pace with the rapid demographic and cultural changes under way in American society .
" Franklin A. Thomas , president of the foundation , was quoted : " To teach the roots of intolerance .
.
.
we must make the teaching of non-Western cultures a basic element of undergraduate education .
" Similarly , Peter Brooks , director of Yale University 's Whitman Center for the Humanities , defends the assault on the traditional curriculum by asserting : <p> People who say we 've got to return to a core curriculum are just nostalgic for a kind of cultural consensus that just does n't exist anymore .
The freshman class at Berkeley is now 80 percent non-white .
That gives you a sense of how much America is changing. 14 <p> The last sentence might more accurately read : " That gives you a sense of how much Berkeley is changing .
" At any rate , it is safe California does not represent the United States in general , precisely if Brooks 's figure of 80 percent is correct .
<p> Consider , also , the proposal that regional accrediting agencies include evidence of student and faculty racial , ethnic , and sexual diversity as part of the criteria for accrediting colleges .
In defending such a policy , Stephen S. Weiner , executive director of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges , asserts without qualification that " American colleges and universities are undergoing massive changes in the racial and ethnic composition of their student bodies .
" 15 Weiner argues that , " In 1988 , white , non-Hispanic students accounted for 65 percent of California 's college enrollment , compared with close to 80 percent for the nation as a whole .
" Exactly : colleges and universities are 80 percent white and not , as Weiner would have us believe , " undergoing massive changes .
" <p> Clearly those who are sounding these themes wish that the United States were different from what it is .
Some people want public policy to be based on envisioned policies .
Responsible educators such as Dale Parnell , president of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges , have warned that Workforce 2000 has been " widely misquoted. " 16 Yet the new demographics myth persists among many educators and education policy makers .
For them , the idea that America 's ethnic mix will soon be transformed appears to be a truth too good to be tested .
<p> Section : REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY <p> Political correctness in American universities is much discussed and often lamented , recently even in mainstream media ; but the focus is usually on elite schools .
Politically correct faculty at universities with lower standing can arguably do more harm , for their students are especially ill-equipped to recognize that indoctrination is being substituted for education .
Certainly during my undergraduate matriculation at a second-tier branch of a state university system I encountered many unrelievedly politically correct professors whose ideological biases my classmates seemed unable to identify and articulate .
<p> The overwhelming force and rigidity of political orthodoxy became so oppressive in an undergraduate research seminar during my final semester that I felt obligated to challenge it .
This effort left me an intellectually demoralized , despairing witness of the professoriate 's ideologically induced indifference -- sometimes , hostility -- to serious debate , contrary viewpoint , and even a sincere search for truth .
Several other students also came to loathe the seminar , but I do not believe they dearly understood the cause of their dissatisfaction or the ideological presuppositions instead of benefiting from a truly open inquiry .
<p> I joined this seminar because one of my professors , I will call him the Ethicist , strongly encouraged me to do so .
Our usual rapport had recently been strained because I had charged in a student evaluation that his personal ethics class had been extremely biased in favor of his quasi-Marxist , radical environmentalist , antiindividualist views .
So disturbed was he by my criticisms that he sought me out to defend his pedagogy -- with the unnerving observation that he has " only fourteen weeks to make students question the values of the dominant culture .
" I retorted that I did n't see his role as that of deprogrammer but as educator .
This unpleasantness notwithstanding , he recruited me for the forthcoming seminar on Indian treaty rights , 1 a project about which he was most enthusiastic .
And because I initially thought that the legal issues involved would place a moderately libertarian person like myself on the side of the pro-minority angels , I signed on .
What Are Indian Treaty Rights ?
its faculty requires some historical background and an explanation of the Indian treaty rights controversy now raging in northern Wisconsin .
As the result of successful litigation initiated by the Chippewa against the State of Wisconsin in the mid-1970s , they are allowed special hunting , fishing , and timber harvesting rights not enjoyed by other citizens , including all other Indians .
Initially , the court determined that the Chippewa were entitled to 100 percent of the " maximum allowable harvest " of various fish and game species on the lands they sold to the federal government a century and a half ago .
The court recently reduced this percentage by half .
<p> The judicial reasoning supporting this decision opened the door for the Chippewa also to claim valuable timber on publicly , and possibly privately , owned land in the northern third of Wisconsin .
Indeed , among the most worrisome consequences of the Chippewa 's court-awarded rights is that real estate titles throughout the upper third of Wisconsin may have been clouded .
As the basis for these resource rights , the Wisconsin Chippewa leadership and their Superior Chippewa and the United States .
<p> The court , in addition to accepting the Chippewa 's claims about these treaties , may employ all manner of modern hunting , fishing , and timber-harvesting methods , including spearfishing 2 and gill netting .
These fishing methods are otherwise prohibited in Wisconsin because they can bleed a lake of its maximum allowable harvest in one day , thereby dosing it for the rest of the fishing season .
Businesspeople in tourism-dependent northern Wisconsin want fishermen to stay at their resorts , eat in their restaurants , and patronize their sportshops .
If Chippewa fishing doses a popular lake in their area or drastically reduces the bag limit , these small businesses can lose a great deal .
Moreover , sportsfishermen 's fishing-license and club fees keep the lakes stocked with such valued species as walleye and muskie , so when the Chippewa -- who do not pay these fees-spearfish egg-bearing fish , many citizens are angered .
Imbalance from the Outset <p> The seminar was composed of a half-dozen students and five faculty members whom I will call Professors Ethicist ( , and Junior Anthropologist .
At our first meeting the faculty handed out a generic syllabus that described various goals of a research seminar , but we students were verbally advised simply to " scratch around " and go wherever our interests took us .
Several professors announced the names of possible contacts for our research , all of whom were Indian activists , lawyers with Indian organizations , or journalists .
<p> At the second meeting Sociologist and Ethicist suggested we consider undertaking a survey of public opinion on treaty rights , and the latter provided his poll on attitudes about affirmative action as a model .
Then several of the faculty showed a film defending treaty rights .
None offered information about representatives opposing treaty rights .
<p> At the third or fourth meeting I began to grasp the ideological raison d'etre of the seminar and to discover the shallowness of the professors ' scholarly standards .
When several described an alleged conspiracy by Exxon and other corporate black hats to funnel money into the anti-treaty rights cause , I quietly listened for some time .
Then I stated significant funding ; indeed , their movement has the hallmarks of a working-class , seat-of-the-pants operation , one too unsophisticated to have either the financial or the public-relations resources of Exxon behind it .
The faculty responded with the assertion that one can not expect to find evidence of such corporate malfeasance because capitalist elites are too " crafty " and " resistant to study " to document their machinations .
Lack of proof notwithstanding , several professors made comments throughout the seminar revealing their assumption of sub rosa corporate dastardliness .
<p> Because no one else seemed inclined to do so , I decided to interview treaty opponents , with whom I was fully prepared to find fault .
The seminar professors had indicated that opponents were calling for " abrogation " of the relevant treaties ; my position was that a Senate-ratified treaty is the law , and its conditions must be upheld and honored .
But by the fifth or sixth seminar meeting I had made contact with and closely examined the literature of some anti-treaty rights activists .
I discovered that the more astute among them did the seminar participants , these opponents argue that the term-specific stipulations of the treaties in question had been fulfilled by the federal government , most of them in the last century .
Furthermore , any issues arising from the inherent inequities of some treaties had been addressed after World War II by the Indian Claims Commission , which ordered additional compensation for the Chippewa as an explicitly final resolution to any residual treaty claims , a condition accepted by the Chippewa and their attorneys at those earlier proceedings .
<p> Many opponents argue that the courts invented the controversial treaty rights by accepting , rather eagerly , a historically dubious explanation for one stipulation in the treaties
